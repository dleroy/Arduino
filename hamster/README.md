# [Hamster Tracker v0.0.1](https://github.com/dleroy/Arduino.git)

Hamster tracker is an Arduino based project to monitor hamster mileage/speed on a hamster wheel.

## Overview

My son read a library book about his new pet hamster. It said hamsters run 6-8 miles per night on the hamster wheel. We decided to
see if that's true so we built an Arduino controller project with a hall effect sensor to monitor the hamsters running activity.

The first revision just collects and calculates stats on the serial monitor of the Arduino. The next major revision will send that
data to a web page and track online.
